Taming WordPress and PHP errors and displaying them properly.

== Description ==

Hate when you get those ugly errors and warnings in your WordPress admin area (especially when WP_DEBUG is turned on)?
WP Admin Error Handler sorts that out by catching all the errors and warnings and displaying them neatly in the admin bar
so you can read them at your convenience.

1. Upload the `wp-admin-error-handler` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Thats it. Errors will appear in the admin bar and in the Tools > Errors page.
